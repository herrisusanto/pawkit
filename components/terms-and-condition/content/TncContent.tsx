              acknowledges and agrees that the Professionals are not employed by

              Professionals&rsquo; provision of Professional Services to the
              Customer creates a direct business relationship between Customer
              and Professional and that Pawkit or Pawkit Affiliates are not
              responsible or liable for the actions or inactions of a Customer
              in relation to the Customer activities.
